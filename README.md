# How to run
```sh
make
make test
```

`make` runs the compiler and generates an executable.
`make test` runs very simple tests.

Note: Passing `make test` does not guarantee the correctness of your program. Testing thoroughly is your responsibility.

# Prerequisites
You must install compiler (`g++`) and the `make` utility (and `git` of course), which are available usually in Linux operating systems. 
Alternatively, you can use Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows.
